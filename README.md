#Immutable class in Java

Following are the requirements:
• Class must be declared as final (So that child classes can’t be created)
• Data members in the class must be declared as final (So that we can’t change the value of it after object creation)
• A parameterized constructor
• Getter method for all the variables in it
• No setters(To not have option to change the value of the instance variable)
