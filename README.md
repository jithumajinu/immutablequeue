#Immutable class in Java
Following are the requirements:<br>
• Class must be declared as final (So that child classes can’t be created) <br>
• Data members in the class must be declared as final (So that we can’t change the value of it after object creation) <br>
• A parameterized constructor <br>
• Getter method for all the variables in it <br>
• No setters(To not have option to change the value of the instance variable) <br>
